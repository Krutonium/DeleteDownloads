# DeleteDownloads

I wrote this program because I have a problem where I don't delete downloads.
This tool should be set up to autorun with Windows or Linux (And maybe MacOS?), and it will calculate the size of your Downloads folder, and if it determines that it is bigger than 200GB, it will offer to delete it for you.
